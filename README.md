# Initium-Super-Handy-Advanced-Reroll-Tool
Yep. You read that right.

How to use:

Seriously, I don't think it's that super newbie friendly, but hey. Basically it logs all your attacks and current stats while you did the attack. It's honestly better if you just try it out.

Features:

EXTREME logging of your stats!
ULTIMATE tracking of attacks!
EXTRAORDINARY saving/loading system!

NOTE: As with the other tool (which I just pretty much copy pasted here), this uses GM_setValue and GM_getValue; If you turn off the script or maybe clear cache, you'll lose your data, so it might be better to export your JSON before then.
